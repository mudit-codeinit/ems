                     <ol class="ml-2 mr-2">

                        <li>The Seller wishes to sell automotive vehicle(s) (a “Vehicle”) through <a href="https://www.expatcarbuyers.com/">Expat Car Buyer</a> LLC (“ECB”), including via the Expat Car Buyer website and/or such other platform or mechanism from time to time operated by ECB or its affiliates (the “Platform”) (the “Services”).</li>

                        <li>The Vehicle Sale Agreement (the “VSA”) to which these terms and conditions (the “Terms”) are appended shall be subject to the terms set out herein. These terms form an integral part of the VSA and shall govern the relationship between the Seller and ECB with respect to the provision of the Services. Subject to paragraph 16, any terms and conditions set out in any order, acknowledgement, invoice or any other issued document shall be of no force and effect.</li>

                        <li>Unless otherwise defined in these Terms, capitalized terms shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the VSA. For the purposes of these Terms, a buyer of any Vehicle of the Seller (whether ECB, one of ECB’s network of dealers or any third party) shall be defined as a <b>“Buyer”.</b></li>

                        <li>The Seller agrees and acknowledges that it may be required to sign other documentation in respect of the Services and the transfer of any Vehicle, including any official legal or regulatory transfer documents, such as a Mubaya.</li>

                        <li>

                           The Seller agrees and acknowledges that ECB:

                           <ol class="ml-2 mr-2">

                              <li>is acting as a “Disclosed Agent” for them, meaning that ECB acts in the name of and on behalf of a Seller and for the benefit of such Seller (also defined as the ‘Principal’ under Article 9(1) of the Federal Decree-law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax) in such cases where the vehicle is sold through ECB but ECB is never the buyer and never the owner of the vehicle.</li>

                              <li>Only ceases to act as a “Disclosed Agent”, only in cases where the vehicle is sold directly to ECB who then buys the vehicle and takes ownership of same.</li>

                              <li>For the avoidance of doubt, ECB will by default be acting as a “Disclosed Agent” unless specifically confirmed in writing to be the scenario as described in 1.5.2 above.</li>

                           </ol>

                        </li>

                     <p>In the event that the Seller has not entered into a VSA, the Seller’s continued use of the Services or instruction in relation thereto shall amount to their acceptance of these Terms, which shall govern the provision of the Services.</p>

During the inspection and at all times until completion of the transfer of title of the Vehicle from the Seller to the Buyer in accordance with paragraph 7.4, risk in respect of such Vehicle shall remain with the Seller.</li>

                        <li>ECB, the relevant Buyer and/or any third party nominated by ECB and/or the relevant Buyer who carries out a Vehicle inspection shall not be liable for any losses, damages, liability, costs (including legal fees) and expenses incurred by the Seller and which may arise as a result of any inspection carried out pursuant to paragraph 5.1, irrespective of cause.</li>
